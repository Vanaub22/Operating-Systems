## **Operating Systems Lab (PCC-CS592)**
This repository contains all of my codes from the course **Operating Systems Laboratory (PCC-CS592)** which was a part of our 5th Semester B.Tech CSE Curriculum.

 - Shell Scripting has been done in **Bourne-again Shell (BASH)**
 - System Programming has been done in **C Langauge** 
 - Apart from **bash**, Assignment-5 will involve writing **awk** scripts as well.

The syllabus is broadly divided into 2 parts: 1. **Shell Scripting** and 2. **System Programming (Process and Thread Management)**.
