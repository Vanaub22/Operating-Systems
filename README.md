## **Operating Systems Lab (PCC-CS592)**
This repository contains all of my codes from the course **Operating Systems Laboratory (PCC-CS592)** which was a part of our 5th Semester B.Tech CSE Curriculum.

 - Shell Scripting has been done in **Bourne-again Shell (BASH)**
 - System Programming has been done in **C Langauge** 
 - Apart from **bash**, Assignment-5 will involve writing **awk** scripts as well.

The syllabus is broadly divided into 2 parts: 1. **Shell Scripting** and 2. **System Programming (Process and Thread Management)**.

## Instructions for Users:
To make your experience with Vim better you may add the following lines to your `.vimrc` file located at `/home/<your_username>`. It is a hidden file and to view it you must use `ls -a` command.
The commands are:

    set autoindent
    set smartindent
    set number
    set mouse=a

I have also added this sample `.vimrc` file that you can copy/paste.
To run your bash scripts from the terminal, either change the permissions first, i.e. assign execute permission to the user using the `chmod` command or run directly using the `bash` command.
For example: 

`chmod u+x <my_script_name>.sh` 	 followed by `./<my_script_name>.sh` 

OR

    bash <my_script_name>.sh
